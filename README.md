# ImageJ_Plugins
Fiji / ImageJ plugins for manipulating and analysing microscopy data.

Assumptions:
You know what ImageJ ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) and/or Fiji are (https://www.fiji.sc).  Fiji Is Just ImageJ with lots of plugins already added.  Secondly, you are using it to process microscope images and want some simple tool to perform a common task.  Thirdly, you have Bioformats (https://imagej.net/Bio-Formats) installed (it is by default in Fiji anyway).

Most of these have been written at the request of users in our Imaging Facility at Newcastle University.  I have added descriptive text to the beginning of each one- they can all be opened in a standard text editor or by clicking Plugins-Macro-Edit in ImageJ/Fiji.

To use any of them, copy the .ijm plugin file to your Plugins directory of ImageJ/Fiji, start the software and the plugin will be found in the list of Plugins.  I recommend opening it first using Plugins-Macros-Edit to read the background of what it does. 

Note: 
I am not a programmer and these are crudely written using ImageJ macro language.  For example, there are no tests to check you have other plugins (eg Bioformats).  Any suggestions/ improvements gratefully received!
